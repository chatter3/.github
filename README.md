# chatter3

Welcome to **chatter3**, a revolutionary Web3-based forum where discussions are signed and verified using blockchain technology. chatter3 enables users to engage in forums where every post is cryptographically signed by the user's wallet, ensuring authenticity and accountability.

## Project Overview

chatter3 integrates blockchain technology into a forum environment, allowing for transparent and secure communications. Each message is tied to a user's wallet address, leveraging the security and immutability of blockchain to enhance trust in online interactions.

## Features

- **Signature Verification**: Every post and comment is signed by the user's private wallet, ensuring the identity of the communicator.
- **Decentralized Moderation**: Uses smart contracts to manage moderation rights and rules, decentralizing control.
